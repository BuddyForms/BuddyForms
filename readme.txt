##GDPR compliant WordPress form builder
BuddyForms comes out of the box GDPR compliant plugin. We've used the time, to improve our data protection even more. What we've done so far:

* *Consent Checkbox* - a new form element has been added to give you an easy option to collect the consent for your user-generated form.
* *Right to access & to be forgotten* - if your users want to get access to their data, you can easily show it with BuddyForms on the front-end. They even have the opportunity to change or delete their data from the front-end.
* *Privacy by Design* - With BuddyForms our goal is it to make you the boss of your data. From the beginning, we've made it a major priority, that you store your data on your own server.

In other words, BuddyForms is 100% approved to be GDPR compliant. The content is saved in on your WordPress hoster either as a post (post & post_meta table) or user data (user & user_meta table).
