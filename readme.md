## Testing
We use [codeception](https://codeception.com/) and webdriver.

#### First Steps
To configure all the needed code to run in your environment you need to follow the next steps:
- Run composer update to get the dependencies
- Create a copy of `.env.testing.example` as `.env.testing`
- Create the database for testing with the name `tests`
- Run Chromedriver in the default port with the base url `/wd/hub`
- Update the file `.env.testing` with the correct information of your environment
- Update your wp-config.php to point to the correct database when the test is running
- Run your first acceptance test local using composer `codecept`. Example command `vendor/bin/codecept run tests/acceptance/testFieldLabelsCest.php --steps`

#### Related commands
* Run chromedriver before start executing the test 
    * `vendor/bin/chromedriver --url-base=/wd/hub`
* Generate Class Test file
    * `vendor/bin/codecept g:cest acceptance <testName>`
* To run all the acceptance test from command line with steps
    * `vendor/bin/codecept run tests/acceptance/SiteNameCest.php --steps`
* To run specific file test from command line with steps
    * `vendor/bin/codecept run <path to the file> --steps`
